# FE Task: Data visualization

Landing page displays data visualization of all apartments.

Implement a form to search and filter apartments. Data widgets are modified after the form submited.

Data visualization explanation:

Pie chart:

- Inner pie chart: Percentage of balcony and non-balcony apartments

- Outer pie chart: Amount of apartments by number of rooms

Area chart:

- Price range of all apartments. Data helps compare price between different places and the lowest/highest price of specific place

Bar chart:

- Amount of apartments built in different period. Each bar is grouped by options (balcony, terrace, storage, open-kitchen, kitchennette)

Line chart:

- Relationship between the number of rooms and average price per square meter
